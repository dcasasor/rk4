# rk4
Runge Kutta Method of 4th order to integrate ODE equations written as a first order system.
The method was tested on three case studies: i) y' = -2*y, ii) Simple pendulum ODE I, iii) Harmonic Oscilator ODE's system

This code is intended to get familiar with Python language, and its accuracy or robustness is not proven sufficiently. Use it under your own risk.
