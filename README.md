# Runge-Kutta 4 in Python

Runge Kutta Method of 4th order to integrate ODE equations written as a first order system.
The method has been tested on three cases:

1. y' = -2 y
2. Simple pendulum ODE,
3. Harmonic Oscilator ODEs system.

The purpose of this code is to get familiar with programming in Python, and its accuracy or robustness is not proven sufficiently. I'm changing it just to learn how to use the terminal.
